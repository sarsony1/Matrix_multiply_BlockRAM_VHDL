------------------------- EPP COMMFPGA IMPLEMENTATION --------------------------

This directory contains Verilog and VHDL code implementing CommFPGA using the
asynchronous Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) interface, which is used in several
Digilent & Avnet USB/FPGA devkits (e.g Basys2, LX9 MicroBoard). It can be used
with the AVR firmware provided.

All of the code here is provided in both VHDL and Verilog. The netlist generated
from each is pretty much identical, so it really doesn't matter which one you
choose.

[vhdl|verilog]/comm_fpga:
    The actual CommFPGA HDL code, implemented in VHDL and separately in Verilog.
    You can just pick one and instantiate it in your code.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_cksum:
    A very simple example project showing how to instantiate the CommFPGA module
    and wire it up so that each channel is wired to a simple register.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_fifo:
    A slightly more involved example showing how to wire the CommFPGA module to
    a pair of FIFOs.

platforms:
    Files describing the board-specific stuff (location constraints, etc).
