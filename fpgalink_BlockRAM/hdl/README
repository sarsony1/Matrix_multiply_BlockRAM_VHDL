----------------- COMMFPGA HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE CODE ------------------

In this directory you will find Hardware Description Language code which
implements the FPGA side of the CommFPGA protocol used by FPGALink devices. The
design is modular, vendor-neutral and implementations are provided in both VHDL
and Verilog.

Subdirectories:
  common - Makefiles needed to build the HDL code for Xilinx or Altera tools.
  fx2 - A CommFPGA implementation using Cypress FX2LP synchronous slave FIFOs.
  epp - A CommFPGA implementation using the asynchronous EPP protocol.
