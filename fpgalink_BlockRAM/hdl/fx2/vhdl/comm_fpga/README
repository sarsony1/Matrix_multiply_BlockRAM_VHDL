-------------------------- VHDL FX2LP COMMFPGA MODULE --------------------------

INTRODUCTION

The CommFPGA module has an external-facing port which more or less connects
directly to a Cypress FX2LP chip, and an internal port consisting of a shared
address bus and a pair of FIFO interfaces (data, valid, ready), one conveying
data written by the host and another conveying data to be read by the host.

You can see two examples of instantiating the CommFPGA module in your own VHDL
by looking in the ex_fifo and ex_cksum directories, alongside this one.


SIMULATION

The CommFPGA module may be simulated using GHDL, and the resulting waves
displayed with GTKWave. Just type "make waves". You will need GHDL and GTKWave
installed.
