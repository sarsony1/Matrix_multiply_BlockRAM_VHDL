------------------- FX2LP SLAVE-FIFO COMMFPGA IMPLEMENTATION -------------------

This directory contains Verilog and VHDL code implementing CommFPGA using the
synchronous slave FIFOs on the Cypress FX2LP, which is used in most Digilent,
KNJN, Trenz and Opal Kelly USB/FPGA devkits (e.g Atlys, Xylo-L etc). It can be
used with the FX2 firmware built into the FPGALink library binary.

All of the code here is provided in both VHDL and Verilog. The netlist generated
from each is pretty much identical, so it really doesn't matter which one you
choose.

[vhdl|verilog]/comm_fpga:
    The actual CommFPGA HDL code, implemented in VHDL and separately in Verilog.
    You can just pick one and instantiate it in your code.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_cksum:
    A very simple example project showing how to instantiate the CommFPGA module
    and wire it up so that each channel is wired to a simple register.

[vhdl|verilog]/ex_fifo:
    A slightly more involved example showing how to wire the CommFPGA module to
    a pair of FIFOs.

platforms:
    Files describing the board-specific stuff (location constraints, etc).
