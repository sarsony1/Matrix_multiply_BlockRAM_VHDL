----------------------------- VERILOG TIMER MODULE -----------------------------

Verilog timer unit. Accepts a clock and a ceiling value. It just counts up and
asserts tick_out when it wraps. The ceiling value specifies (roughly speaking)
the number of bits to use in the counter.

The actual formula is that tick_out is high for one cycle, then low for a
number of cycles given by 2^(COUNTER_WIDTH - ceiling_in). You should make sure
COUNTER_WIDTH > 2^CEILING_WIDTH.

COUNTER_WIDTH=4:
  CEILING_WIDTH=2:
    ceiling_in=0: tick_out high for one cycle, low for 16 cycles
    ceiling_in=1: tick_out high for one cycle, low for 8 cycles
    ceiling_in=2: tick_out high for one cycle, low for 4 cycles
    ceiling_in=3: tick_out high for one cycle, low for 2 cycles
